# Project Lead Guide 

Are you encouraging, inspiring, and detail oriented? Become a project lead! If this interests you, we ask that you:
* prepare your project in advance 
* be available either Saturday July 28th through Sunday July 29th, or Monday July 30th through Friday August 3rd 

## FAQ

### How long should projects last?

#### Should projects aim to last the full duration of the sprints?

#### Is there a minimum amount of time that a project should be expected to take?

### Should project leads expect to only work on & lead their project?

#### How will we coordinate between project leads (if they're working on other projects)?

### How can a project lead prepare their project to effectively enable people to contribute?

#### Should projects be organised around repositories/specific features?

#### How do we balance particular goals against introducing people to projects?

### How do we approach merging infrastructure changes? 

For example (both of these happened during the winter sprint): 
- Infrastructure changes during the sprint may enable other projects to go faster on their 
  work. 
- Infrastructure changes during the sprint may disrupt the ability of other projects to 
  proceed with their work.

### Should leaders focus on helping others to make changes and or to make changes themselves?

Not being explicit about this can cause stress when many people are asking for one person's
attention/help and the situation is exacerbated if the person had expected to be able to work
on work of their own on top of helping others. 

NB: this issue affected @rgbkrk during the winter sprint.

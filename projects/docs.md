## Documentation!

**Lead**: Kyle Kelley ([@rgbkrk](https://github.com/rgbkrk))

**Project**: Let's create two sites for documentation, one that is user-focused and one that is developer-focused.

## `docs.nteract.io`

User facing documentation on nteract

* How to guides
* User interface overview

This also spans our collection of example notebooks. We need to show people how to be effective with nteract.

* How to use the Data Explorer
* Using Vega / Altair

and more!

## `devdocs.nteract.io`

Developer focused documentation to help us build nteract and enable more people to join us.

* Guides
  * Getting started with the monorepo
  * Software Design
  * React performance tips
* Tutorials
* Raw API docs

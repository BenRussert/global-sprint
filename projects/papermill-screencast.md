# Create a papermill Screencast!

Sometimes you don't know you need a new tool until you see someone else using it. Other times you just like jupyter notebooks and want to see something interesting that you can use down the line!

## Objective:

Create a relatively short demo that would expose would-be users to papermill quickly.

The aim is to answer these types of questions:

- What is papermill used for?
- What does a papermill workflow look like?
- How can I use papermill to make my life easier?

These points are answered in the docs and readme, but a screencast is another way of exposing others to the concepts.
